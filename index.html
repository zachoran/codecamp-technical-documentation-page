                <p class="info">The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the Proto-Germanic *wulfaz.
                The Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin word for the animal lupus (*lúkʷos).
                The name "gray wolf" refers to the grayish colour of the species.</p>

                <p class="info">Since pre-Christian times, Germanic peoples such as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their names.
                Examples include Wulfhere <code>("Wolf Army", or "He whose army is the wolf")</code>, Cynewulf <code>("Royal Wolf")</code>, Cēnwulf
                <code>("Bold Wolf")</code>, Wulfheard <code>("Wolf-hard")</code>, Earnwulf <code>("Eagle Wolf")</code>, Wulfstān <code>("Wolf Stone")</code>, 
                Æðelwulf <code>("Noble Wolf")</code>, Wolfhroc <code>("Wolf-Frock")</code>, Wolfhetan <code>("Wolf Hide")</code>, Isangrim <code>("Gray Mask")</code>,
                Scrutolf <code>("Garb Wolf")</code>, Wolfgang <code>("Wolf Gait")</code>, and Wolfdregil <code>("Wolf Runner")</code>.</p>

                <p class="info">The wolf is the largest member of the Canidae family, and is further distinguished from coyotes and jackals by a broader snout,
                shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail. It is slender and powerfully built with a large, deeply descending rib cage, a 
                sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal
                to move swiftly, and to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter. The ears are relatively small and
                triangular. The wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle. The skull is
                230–280 mm (9–11 in) in length and 130–150 mm (5–6 in) in width. The teeth are heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing 
                bone than those of other canids. They are not as specialized as those found in hyenas though. Its molars have a flat chewing surface,
                but not to the same extent as the coyote, whose diet contains more vegetable matter. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads,
                thinner necks, slightly shorter legs, and less massive shoulders than males.</p>
            
                <p class="info">Adult wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height. The tail measures 29–50 cm (11–20 in)
                in length, the ears 90–110 mm (3 1⁄2–4 3⁄8 in) in height, and the hind feet are 220–250 mm (8 5⁄8–9 7⁄8 in).[42] The size and weight of the
                modern wolf increases proportionally with latitude in accord with Bergmann's rule. The mean body mass of the wolf is 40 kg (88 lb), the
                smallest specimen recorded at 12 kg (26 lb) and the largest at 79.4 kg (175 lb). On average, European wolves weigh 38.5 kg (85 lb),
                North American wolves 36 kg (79 lb), and Indian and Arabian wolves 25 kg (55 lb). Females in any given wolf population typically
                weigh 2.3–4.5 kg (5–10 lb) less than males. Wolves weighing over 54 kg (119 lb) are uncommon, though exceptionally large individuals have
                been recorded in Alaska and Canada. In middle Russia, exceptionally large males are given a maximum weight of 69–79 kg (152–174 lb).</p>

                <p class="info">Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs; single wolves have occasionally been
                observed to kill large prey such as moose, bison and muskoxen unaided. This contrasts with the commonly held belief that larger
                packs benefit from cooperative hunting to bring down large game. The size of a wolf hunting pack is related to the number of pups that
                survived the previous winter, adult survival, and the rate of dispersing wolves leaving the pack. The optimal pack size for hunting elk is
                four wolves, and for bison a large pack size is more successful.</p>
            
                <p class="info">As well as their physical adaptations for hunting hoofed mammals, wolves possess certain behavioural, cognitive, and psychological 
                adaptations to assist with their hunting lifestyle. Wolves are excellent learners that match or outperform domestic dogs. They can use
                gaze to focus attention on where other wolves are looking. This is important because wolves do not use vocalization when hunting. In
                laboratory tests, they appear to exhibit insight, foresight, understanding, and the ability to plan. To survive, wolves must be able
                to solve two problems—finding a prey animal, then confronting it.</p>

                <p class="info">Wolves move around their territory when hunting, using the same trails for extended periods. After snowfalls, wolves find their old
                trails and continue using them. These follow the banks of rivers, the shorelines of lakes, through ravines overgrown with shrubs,
                through plantations, or roads and human paths. Wolves are nocturnal predators. During the winter, a pack will commence hunting
                in the twilight of early evening and will hunt all night, traveling tens of kilometres. Sometimes hunting large prey occurs during the
                day. During the summer, wolves generally tend to hunt individually, ambushing their prey and rarely giving pursuit.</p>
            
                <p class="info">The wolf usually travels at a loping pace, placing one of its paws directly in front of the other. This gait can be maintained for hours
                at a rate of 8–9 km/h (5.0–5.6 mph). On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of 50–60 km/h (31–37 mph). The wolf has a
                running gait of 55–70 km/h (34–43 mph), can leap 5 m (16 ft) horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at
                least 20 minutes. A wolf's foot is large and flexible, which allows it to tread on a wide variety of terrain. A wolf's legs are
                long compared to their body size allowing them to travel up to 76 km (47 mi) in 12 hours. This adaptation allows wolves to locate prey
                within hours, but it can take days to find prey that can be killed without great risk. Moose and deer live singly in the summer. Caribou
                live in herds of thousands which presents dangers for wolves. Elk live in small herds and these are a safer target.</p>

                <p class="info">In Canada, 50,000–60,000 wolves live in 80% of their historical range, making Canada an important stronghold for the species. Under
                Canadian law, First Nations people can hunt wolves without restrictions, but others must acquire licenses for the hunting and trapping
                seasons. As many as 4,000 wolves may be harvested in Canada each year.[140] The wolf is a protected species in national parks under the
                Canada National Parks Act. In Alaska, 7,000–11,000 wolves are found on 85% of the state's 1,517,733 km2 (586,000 sq mi). Wolves may
                be hunted or trapped with a license; around 1,200 wolves are harvested annually.</p>
            
                <p class="info">In the contiguous United States, wolf declines were caused by the expansion of agriculture, the decimation of the wolf's main prey species
                like the American bison, and extermination campaigns. Wolves were given protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, and have
                since returned to parts of their former range thanks to both natural recolonizations and reintroductions. Wolf populations in the Great Lakes
                states of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan number over 4,000 as of 2018. Wolves also occupy much of the northern Rocky Mountains region, with
                at least 1,704 wolves in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming as of 2015. They have also established populations in Washington and Oregon. In Mexico and
                parts of the southwestern United States, the Mexican and U.S. governments collaborated from 1977 to 1980 in capturing all Mexican wolves remaining
                in the wild to prevent their extinction and established captive breeding programs for reintroduction. As of 2018, there were 230 Mexican wolves
                living in Mexico, 64 in Arizona, 67 in New Mexico, and 240 in captive breeding programs in both countries.</p>
